1. The app is still usable in offline mode because it use data on internal storage, or at least partially useful
2. For bad connection, no connection and it offers "Web app Installation"
3. If the server is down, user cannot access contents, so show only the internal data storage that has been downloaded to the user's storage.

The design pattern
======
1. When online, get the data and store it in internal storage
2. When offline, show only the internal storage. When online, show the internal storage too (but update the data when the connection is available)
3. Disable online features in Offline mode (limited feature on offline mode)
